            <h2>The Arts:</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Before I could walk, I'd pick up some crayons and doodle. Art has shaped me into the person I am today and completely transformed the lense on my perspective of the world. I love working with different mediums like acrylic, pencil, charcol, oil pastels, digital, and 3D modelling. During the COVID-19 quarantine, I started an art account to track my progress and now I'm currently working on launching my small art business as well as my personal art portfolio. Feel free to check out my Instagram account! </p>

            <h2>Taekwondo:</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Taekwondo first became an integral part of my life nearly 8 years ago. This sport has strengthened both my physical and mental health. More recently, I've begun giving back to the Taekwondo community by teaching students as an Instructor. I teach students from ages 4-50+ and I absolutely love how rewarding it is to teach others. Check out some photos of me from Taekwondo here:</p>

            <h2>Hiking:</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Over the years, hiking has become a growing outlet for me to momentarily escape from the academically vigorious workload at hand. I've learned to "enjoy the moment" and foster deeper connections with friends and family members through this activity. Hiking especially throughout the province of B.C. has never failed to leave me astonished and in awe each time from the unique sceneic views all year long. Feel free to enjoy some highlights from my hikes this year! </p>
